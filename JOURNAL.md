This project is meant to compare an actual website to a set of criteria, which form Acceptance Tests for the website.

The first thing we want to know about the website is that all of the current URLs point to an expected location.

My plan is to write a bash script and then consider writing a puppeteer based nodejs script to do more advanced operations, like generating screenshots of all the website pages.
